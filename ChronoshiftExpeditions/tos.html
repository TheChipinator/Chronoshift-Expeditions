            <h3> 
            The staff at Chronoshift expeditions is not responsible for your safety and if you break any rules the tour/safari will be cancelled immediately at the staffâ€™s discretion. 
            Should such an event occur, the user will be refunded half the amount they have paid for the tour/safari. 
            By agreeing to the terms and conditions you agree that the staff have no requirement to ensure your safety and that if you break any of the rules or the safari master/tour guide deems that the trip must end, 
            it will end with no debate or there will be legal repercussions and lawsuits filed against the participant.
