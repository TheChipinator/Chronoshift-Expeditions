                        Sweet But Short History
                    </u> 
                        <br>
                            Our company started in 1947 doing tours in South Africa led by veterans but in 1967 a scientist had given us an offer to build a time machine for us.
                            We accepted and had built the first successful time machine ever or at least the most famous one.
                            Ever since then our founder and CEO has since retired but has left a legacy of quality service and thrill seeking adventures with our wonderful Safari-masters 
                            and hunting party leaders.

                    The way our time machine operates has remained a secret for almost 60 years and the company isn't planned on releasing the secrets to it anytime soon, 
                    however many previous users describe it as a “howling sensation... you hear the nights and days whirl by... you feel the days and nights reversing as if it were a cassette tape rewinding...”
